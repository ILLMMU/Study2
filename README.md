# Study2-Light-and-WFH
This study aims to investigate the influence of different home lighting environments and 'light behavior' on sleep, mood and cognitive functioning. Your participation will help us gain a deeper understanding of how we can modify home lighting and light behavior for optimum performance while we work from home during Covid-19 lockdown in Malaysia.
